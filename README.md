# my-anki-decks
These are my Anki decks. You are more than welcome to use them. However you will need to commit to my way of using Anki which may not be compatible with yours.

My use of Anki goes back to a few years. Recently, Michael Nielsen wrote an [article](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) about it and rekindled people's interest in Anki. Michael claims that 95% of Anki's power comes from 5% of its features and my experience suggests that he is right. I primarily use the cards with "Cloze Deletions".

Enjoy.
